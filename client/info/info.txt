Pagination: An Overview
    Pagination is a design pattern commonly used in web applications to manage and display large sets of data or content by dividing it into smaller, more manageable parts called "pages." This pattern is widely employed in scenarios where presenting all the information at once could be overwhelming for users or would lead to a slower loading time.

Key Components of Pagination:
Pages:
    The total dataset is divided into separate pages, each containing a specific number of items. For example, you might have 20 items per page.

Navigation Controls:
    Pagination includes controls that allow users to navigate between pages. Common controls include page numbers, "Next" and "Previous" buttons, and sometimes, "First" and "Last" buttons.

User Control:
    Pagination empowers users to control the amount of data they want to view at a given time. Users can move forward or backward through pages, enabling them to access different sections of the dataset.

Advantages of Pagination:
Improved User Experience:
    By breaking content into pages, users can consume information more comfortably without being overwhelmed.

Faster Loading Times:
    Loading only a subset of data at a time reduces the initial load time, contributing to a better user experience.

Structured Presentation:
    Pagination provides a structured way to present large datasets, making it easier for users to navigate.

Implementation:
Backend:
    On the backend, pagination involves serving a limited amount of data per request, determined by parameters such as page number, page size, and sorting criteria.

Frontend:
    Frontend components, such as page navigation buttons, are linked to the backend, ensuring users receive the correct subset of data when interacting with the pagination controls.

Pagination Examples:
        Page Numbers:
            Pages are often represented by numbers, allowing users to click on a specific page to navigate directly.

Next and Previous Buttons:
    Users can move forward and backward one page at a time using "Next" and "Previous" buttons.

Ellipsis (...):
    When there are many pages, ellipsis may be used to represent a range of pages not displayed explicitly.

SEO Considerations:
    Properly implemented pagination includes meta tags and rel attributes to inform search engines about the structure of paginated content.

Accessibility:
    Designing pagination with accessibility in mind ensures users with disabilities can navigate through pages using assistive technologies.
